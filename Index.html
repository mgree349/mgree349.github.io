        <p><strong>Guide to Making Your Own Stuffed Animal:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Draw your stuffed animal shape on a piece of paper:</strong> this design can be any shape or size and will become your<strong>pattern</strong>. Once you decide on your shape, add about a 1/2" border, which will be your <strong>inseam.</strong></li>
            
        <li><strong>Cut your paper pattern out:</strong> make sure to cut around your inseam, and not just your drawing.
        <li><strong>Place your pattern on top of a piece of fabric </strong>and cut it out, then do that a second time. One piece will act as the front of your stuffed animal, and the other will become the back.
               <ul>
                    <li>To hold your pattern down while you cut the fabric, you can use pins, tape, or even draw the pattern onto the fabric with washable marker or a pencil</li>
                </ul>
         <li><strong>Make a little face!</strong> This can be embroidered, sewn, or drawn  directly on to the front piece of fabric. If you're drawing the face, make sure to use a permanent marker.
                <ul>
                    <li> You can also make a face on a different colored piece of fabric, and sew it on top of your front piece!</li>
                </ul>
         <li><strong>Pin your fabric together inside out:</strong> make sure the two side of the fabric you want to see at the end (like the side with your face on it) are facing inward toward each other </li>
            <li><strong>Sew your pieces together:</strong> this can be done with a sewing machine, by hand, or even with a stapler. Anything that keeps the two sides together works :)
                <ul>
                    <li> No matter how you sew it, make sure to leave about an inch unsewn so you can flip your stuffed animal and stuff it! This works best on a leg or straighter line.</li>
                </ul>
        <li><strong>Flip your stuffed animal inside out:</strong> use the unsewn hole you created as an opening to pull your fabric through and turn it inside out. Don't worry if this is a bit hard! It may take some work.
                <ul>
                    <li>Once your stuffed animal is inside out, your raw stiches should be hidden and the face you made should be visible</li>
            </ul>
        <li><strong>Stuff your stuffed animal:</strong> fill it with the stuffing of your choice, using some sort of wooden stick (chopstick, pencil) to make sure the limbs or hard-to-get-to part of your animal are filled</li>
            <li><strong>Close up the opening:</strong> sew up the small hole you used to turn your stuffed animal inside out and stuff it. Knot the final stitch to make sure it stays in place and cut the excess thread.
                <ul>
                    <li>Using a ladder stitch helps best hide the hole once sewn up</li>
            </ul>
        <li><strong>Optional:</strong> continue to decorate your stuffed anmal! You can sew buttons, add little clothes, or use fabric and fabric glue to embellish your stuffed animal even further.</li>
        </ol>
